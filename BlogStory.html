    <P>We have a lot to say but in doubts about the right people.</P>
    <p>Our cities light up in full glare, outshinning the effects of the moon.</p>
    <p>Maybe we could go to the woods but what about the wolfs?</p>
    <p>Okay, we need others' opinion and advise;</p>
    <p>We need their attention;</p>
    <p>We need their love and care;</p>
    <p>But maybe we do not know where to look or sound too direct or forward.</p>
    <p>Then we can send it to the moon to reflect our minds, hearts and longings.</p>
    <p>Yes, Yes!</p>
    <p>We can take the world down the line of mind-full thoughts; exposing them to our creative mind in telling stories.</p>
